Application - Concordium Grant Program

## Project name
The name of the project is: Non-fungible Reference Blockchain System

## Project overview
 
### General
In order to build a truly decentralized Web3, we think the key is to enable and incentivize everyone to allow others to develop and manage their online service and work freely and equally the same as themselves. So we want to propose a new reference system on blockchain that records and reflects the reference relationship between the referred old works and the new works that are based on others’ old works. By referring to the old work of others openly, anyone could freely do any improvements, updates or combinations on the old work to create new work, and all the earnings of the new work will be traced and shared transparently among the new work and all its referred old works to reward the old works for their opening and sharing of governance rights.

### Description 
* We want to make a reference system that records and reflects the reference relationship between the referred old works and the new works that are based on others’ old works. By referring to the old work, anyone can build new work based on any other’s work to create better online service.
* In order to collect and tack the earnings of the new work, based on the reference system, we want to make a reference token standard that users and service providers can pay for the new work for usage, and investors can purchase the shares of the new work and get its earnings according to the shares they own.
* In order to incentive the opening of the old work, we want to make a revenue distribution scheme that new work will share its earnings with all its referred old work, and the return of opening and sharing should more than closure and monopoly.

In order to achieve these goals, we need your technical support to design, build and test our proposed solution better like professional guidance and critiques from your developers and engineers.

It would  be better if we could also get your community support to evaluate acceptance and feasibility of our proposed solution for target users and relevant stakeholders, and improve our proposal accordingly.


### Submission
After getting your grant, we will start working according to this proposal, and submit the deliverables as planned.

### Benchmark

Please name the projects you are competing with: 

We think Some DAO programs may be similar to ours. But they give limited rights and freedom of self-governance to the community, and a central team like founders or a company still has privilege on the governance. Staking increases the threshold of participating in self-governance with more inequality and privilege. Voting can meet the needs of the majority, but not everyone, so some people still need to compromise.

Many DeFi applications also explore composability and interoperability Some projects combine with others to have new features (Curve), or improve the existing ones (Sushiswap), or achieve the expected function or features of applications (Oracle). But their composition is predefined rather than freely compose without limitation, and they only compose externally made by the founding team rather than internally by everyone.

## Development 
Our planned timeline is that after getting your grant:

1. First month: make the formal research plan determining the research details including scope, goal, participants, and schedule

2. Second month: do research on addressing defined problems and designing possible solution to produce draft of research proposal

3. Third month: develop a demo to test the effectiveness of the proposed research solution

4. Fourth month: improve the solution according to the result of the test

5. Fifth month: publish the improved demo to Ethereum community to ask for critiques

6. Sixth month: evaluate the solution according to the critiques, and finalize the research proposal

Funding Plan (negotiable):

$10,000: Design and build demo for our proposed solution

$20,000: Test the demo for evaluating our proposed solution

$20,000: Promote our testing, invite and encourage users to try and give feedback
