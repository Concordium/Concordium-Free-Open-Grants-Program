# **Concordium Projects Application Grant**
Bictory finance is building the first project discovery, events and educational platform exclusively made for Concordium. 

Concordium Project is a crowdsourcing platform which will enable developers, founders and start ups to submit their project for promotion and feature. Our end goal is to foster growth within the Concordium ecosystem and promote all emerging projects in the space.

Through an integration with the Concordium blockchain, We will work by maintaining concordium-nodes (HA). Bictory application servers will communicate with concordium-nodes through the API that will wrap a gRPC interface exposed by the concordium-node.

Our team has vast experience in blockchain projects, security, and scalability, and we are excited about the Concordium blockchain and its smart-contracts capability. We see this as an opportunity to build a needed product on new top-notch emerging technology.
### **Description:**
- Each project will be divided in a categories such as DeFi, NFT, Wallet, Application, Tooling, Events and Seminars
- We will use this as a central hub for events, seminar and knowledge-base content
- We plan to opensource the technology on building products on top of Concordium

**Current problems/issues you are encountering:**

- Deployment of RPC Nodes
- Data Retrieval of Market-cap, Index and Project Ranking

**How could Concordium help you?**

- Concordium could help us understand the best way to add deploy and retrieve data from different projects built on top of concordium
