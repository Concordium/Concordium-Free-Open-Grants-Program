# **Concordium Projects Application Grant**
Bictory finance is building the first project discovery, events, educational platform exclusively made for projects building on top of Concordium. Concordium projects will have perks and initiatives, designed to engage and reward community members with the goal of using the community as a key marketing vehicle in promoting awareness of projects built on Concordium, which ultimately promotes Concordium. 

Concordium Project is a crowdsourcing platform that will enable developers, founders, and start-ups to submit their projects for promotion and feature. Our end goal is to foster growth within the Concordium ecosystem and promote all emerging projects in the space.

Through an integration with the Concordium blockchain, We will work by maintaining concordium-nodes (HA). Bictory application servers will communicate with concordium-nodes through the API that will wrap a gRPC interface exposed by the concordium-node.

Our team has vast experience in blockchain projects, security, and scalability, and we are excited about the Concordium blockchain and its smart-contracts capability. We see this as an opportunity to build a needed product on new top-notch emerging technology, that will benefit the community via platform engagement and interaction.
### **Description:**
- Each project will be divided into categories such as DeFi, NFT, Wallet, Application, Tooling, Events, and Seminars
- We will use this as a central hub for events, seminars, and knowledge-base content
- We plan to opensource the technology on building products on top of Concordium
- Also, there will be an airdrop section for airdrop and bounty programs being offered by projects across the Concordium network, users can signup/connect their wallets to take part in it
- There will be an Earn tab where users could get tokens daily for visiting the site, similar to Coingecko’s candies, and [Zapper.fi](http://Zapper.fi) the goal is to onboard users from other blockchains in so doing, generate tremendous traffic and awareness for the building of the project on Concordium

**Current problems/issues you are encountering:**

- Deployment of RPC Nodes
- Data Retrieval of Market-cap, Index, and Project Ranking

**How could Concordium help you?**

- Concordium could help us understand the best way to add deploy and retrieve data from different projects built on top of Concordium.
