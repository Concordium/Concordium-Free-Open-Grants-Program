# Free & Open Grant Proposal Technical Template
## Project name
The name of the project is: Consys Wallet

## Project overview
 
### General
Consys Wallet is a response to an [RFP for Alpha Centauri in the Concordium Stack](https://github.com/Concordium/Concordium-Free-Open-Grants-Program/blob/main/rfps/RFP-Alpha-Centauri.md). This is thought to be a wallet designed as a browser extension like those of Polkadot, Ethereum, Tron and other common blockchains. The initial idea is not only making a wallet for transactions, but also let a user to login to a third party web sites using his Consys wallet (private key) and even more (examples in the "Future plans" section).

We, Bela Supernova, are a trusted blockchain community contributor. Our solutions facilitate blockchain integration into day-to-day life. We build for Polkadot, Ethereum, Filecoin, Cosmos and other ecosystems. We are incredibly impressed with the very idea of decentralized and trustless services and strive to give maximum efforts to building cosmic but comfortable Web3 space for all users, especially those who are not blockchain geeks. Ubiquitous, intuitional and understandable. Concordium is a young but promising and technologically interesting blockchain, contributing to Concordium for us is a great opportunity to bring more value to the Web3 world and drive our skills in developing cutting-edge technologies.

### Description 
Consys is not just a wallet as we expect. We plan to add APIs for loging into third party web sites and services with the wallet credentials - that's for the start. And finally we see an opportunity to offer a cutting-edge technology for a decentralised password manager: a smart contract will store all credentials in an encrypted state with a wallet secret key as a master-password for the storage.

### Submission
Tech stack overview: The extension will be developed using JavaScript.

### Benchmark

Please name the projects you are compeeting with: actually, as we can see, there are no extension wallets in Concordium right now. As well as decentralised password managers (in other networks too)

### Community and marketing
As this application is made as an offer for one of the Concordium's RFPs we'd like to introduce here some of our projects as our contribution to the BC community.
- Our ipEHR project under the Filecoin RFP: [ipEHR (OpenEHR Integration)](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway);
-	Our OCEX project under the Web3 Foundation grant for the Polkadot network: [OCEX (On-chain cash exchange)](https://github.com/bsn-si/ocex-smartcontract).

### What's next?
Follow up grants will be:
1. API development for authorization in third party dApps and making transactions using your Consys wallet.
2. Blockchain-based password manager with the wallet private key as a master-password (logging in to the password manager with your Concordium account)
